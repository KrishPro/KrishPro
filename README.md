- 📫 How to reach me ? by mailing at krishbaisoya.it2020@gmail.com

I've rich experience in Computer Vision (CNNs) & Squential Data (LSTMs)\
Currently I  use PyTorch for most of my projects (from the July 2021, class 8th).\
Earlier i was using Tensorflow for my projects

But, I've also worked in Angular, Ionic and Capacitor.

I also have my first [app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.kp_baisoya.image_to_pdf) live on play store.
Called `Images to PDF`, In this application you can load up a bunch of images (any image format) and then by just a click of a button you can convert many jpegs to one pdf.
That's It!
